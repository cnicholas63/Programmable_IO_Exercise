CIS3105 - Embedded Systems Tutorial Project

This project is a modified version of KEIL's Blinky example project.
The modifications are designed to enable the students to start configuring
the ARM Cortex-M3 MCU (STM32F103ZG) on KEIL's evaluation board MCBSTM32EXL
in order to do some basic MCU functions.

This project is expected to be incrementally developed by the students
starting from basic LED functions to more sophisticated interrupt handling
functions such as responding buttons and joystick movements. Additional
functions will be built as and when required and appropriate.
